# Project Journal: Mempool Orchestrator

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Q1 2026)

### 2026-01-18 | E2E Ingestion Pipeline & Infrastructure Hardening
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Objective:** Establish a high-performance, event-driven backbone to capture real-time Bitcoin mempool data and ensure architectural parity between local development and production-ready systems.

**Actions:**
1.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Provisioned a surgical development environment on **macOS M4** using **OrbStack** for container management and **uv** for Python dependency resolution.
    * Enforced **Python 3.12** across the stack to leverage `asyncio` performance gains and modern type hinting.
2.  **Infrastructure Deployment:**
    * Deployed a **Redpanda** broker via Docker Compose. Selected for its native ARM64 efficiency and JVM-free architecture, minimizing resource overhead on the M4 silicon.
    * Initialized the `mempool-raw` topic with `acks=1` for balanced durability.
3.  **Application Layer - Ingestor Engine:**
    * **Core Logic:** Implemented a modular package structure under `src/`.
    * **`src/common/kafka_producer.py`**: Engineered a high-level producer wrapper using `confluent-kafka`. Optimized with non-blocking `poll(0)` calls to handle delivery reports without saturating the event loop.
    * **`src/ingestors/mempool_ws.py`**: Developed an asynchronous WebSocket client for `mempool.space`. Implemented the specific subscription protocol (`want-stats`, `track-mempool`) to stream live transaction batches.
4.  **E2E Pipeline Validation:**
    * Successfully streamed live mempool data from external WebSockets into the local Redpanda bus.
    * Verified data persistence and JSON integrity via `rpk topic consume`, confirming successful offsets and key-value delivery.

**Technical Deep Dive: Infrastructure Verification**
To audit the broker's health and ensure a stable backbone, we utilized the following baseline command:
`docker exec -it infra-redpanda-1 rpk cluster health`

**Parameter Breakdown:**
- `docker exec`: Executes a command in a running container namespace.
- `-i` (interactive): Keeps STDIN open for real-time interaction.
- `-t` (tty): Allocates a pseudo-TTY for proper terminal output formatting.
- `infra-redpanda-1`: Target container identifier defined in the `infra` stack.
- `rpk`: Redpanda Keeper; the performance-oriented CLI for cluster management.
- `cluster health`: Subcommand to verify node connectivity and leader election status.

**Technical Challenges & Resolutions:**
- **Module Resolution:** Addressed `ModuleNotFoundError` by transitioning from direct script execution to **Module Execution Mode** (`python -m src.ingestors.mempool_ws`). Added `__init__.py` markers to formalize the package namespace.
- **Dependency Synchronization:** Resolved a `uv.lock` version drift by executing a full `uv sync` after manual `pyproject.toml` updates, ensuring a deterministic build environment.
- **Connectivity Handling:** Identified `Connection refused` errors caused by inactive containers. Implemented a pre-runtime network probe routine (`nc -zv`) for broker availability.
